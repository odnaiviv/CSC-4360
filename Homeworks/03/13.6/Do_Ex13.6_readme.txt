13.6 
1) open app on phone emulator 
2) you should see "Meal Rater!" text with "Restaurant Name" & "Meal Name" empty text fields 
 - there should also be "Rate Meal" & "Save" buttons, and "Overall Rating: " with the current rating of "1" 
3) enter in restaurant name & meal name in empty text fields 
 - for this case, I used McDonald's and Quarter Pounder as the restaurant & meal respectively 
4) click on "Rate Meal" button 
 - a screen should pop up with current "Rating" on screen with "-" and "+" stepper buttons 
 - this allows you to pick your rating from 1 to 5 
5) click on "+" to increase rating and "-" to decrease rating 
 - for this case, I rated this as 3, so I clicked on "+" two times 
6) drag the screen back down & overall rating should show your rating 
7) click on "Save" to save rating 

This is where 13.6 differs from 11.13 and 12.9. 

8) on the main page, there should be "Restaurant Location" button under "Save" 
 - click on "Restaurant Location" button & this should take you to a new page 
9) you should see the restaurant name as the title, four different buttons, and "Latitude: " & "Longitude: " texts 
 - the four buttons are "Look Up", "From My Location", "Save Location", and "Back to Main" 
10) click on "Look Up" 
 - you should see "Email Address: " text field & "Find" button pop up 
11) enter in address & click "Find" 
 - i made something up like 1234 Main Street New York City, NY 12345 
12) the latitude & longitude coordinates should now show the address location 
 - in this case, my latitude is 40.756745 & my longitude is -73.9554537 
13) click "Save Location" 
 - latitude & longitude should be saved in Core Data 
14) click "Back to Menu" 
 - this should take you back to the meal rater page again 


Notes: 
This one gave me a lot of problems as well >:( In theory my "Back to Menu" should work but it's not???? It worked with the ListView, why didn't it work here as well? :/
