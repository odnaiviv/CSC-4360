1) open app on phone emulator 
2) click on "Button" at bottom of screen 
3) this should take you to different page with another "Button" in the middle 
4) click on "Button" again 
5) this should take you back to the first page 


Notes: 
I addded the same method/function from MainActivity.java to SecondActivity.java for the buttons. This should make the app swap between pages when the button is clicked on!
