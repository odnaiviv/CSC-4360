1) open app on phone emulator 
2) click on "Button" at bottom of screen 
3) this should take you to different page with another "Button" in the middle 
4) click on "Button" again 
5) this should take you back to the first page 


Notes: 
This app is a carbon copy of Do_Lab02.zip so everything should look the exact same. I've only changed the names of my files to Lab02a instead of Lab02 like how they're supposed to be in the slides. This is just to keep everything organized!
